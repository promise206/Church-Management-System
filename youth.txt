This was a fellowship of young vibrant Christians and they entertained the congregation in most occasions with thir melodies songs. They made worship an exciting experience and they did the manual jobs of the church. They also actively evangelized in various forms. They engaged in humanitarian activates. Their activities reached the climax in the early 1960s and through them the Anglican Church won many converts. St. Pauls Anglican Youth fellowship had in its fold on time or the other men like Mr. Ebenezer Ofoma, Stephen Ukadike, Emmanuel Nwawelu, Peter Okafor, Henry Nwokolo, Solomon Okpala, Ephraim Ezume and Isaac Okpala, to mention a few. Other young men who served as astute youth leaders included Mr. F.C.Z. Okpala, Mr. Innocent Nwokolo, Mr. Emma Onua, etc. 
Today this organization is still strong under the able leadership of Mr. Elochukwu Obidike. One remembers their clarion call with excitement- Ndi Youth Holy, Holy  Holy, Holy.
